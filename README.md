#StrawVote

Currently hosted on [Heroku](https://voting-app-sj.herokuapp.com/)

StrawPoll-inspired challenge project, idea from the Dev Jam Discord server. Users can create multiple-choice polls or vote on polls from other users.

My personal goal for this project is to learn NextJS, Material UI, and Heroku deployment.

Written in JS (React, Next, Express, Axios), SCSS and Material UI, and MongoDB through Mongo Atlas.
